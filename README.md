# Event App Andorid

This project was conceived with the idea of creating an application that would allow us to create both public and private events, and share them with those we want. Depending on the type they would be visible to everyone or only to those who have received the invitation, for public events the concept of events of interest was created, for which if the user initially selected a type or several public events of interest, when approaching a certain radius of these would be notified that one of them is taking place at that moment.
